This directory contains the files you will need for the CS:APP
Performance Lab.

Files you modify and handle in:

kernels.c
	This is the file orders your solution in a logical order.

line-versions.h
	This file defines manageable code: it couples a description to a function_call.

line-versions.c
	This file contains all solutions you came up with.

# You shouldn't modify any of these files
#########################################
driver.c
	This is the driver that tests the performance of all 
	of the versions of the rotate and smooth kernels 
	in your kernels.c file.

config.h
	This is a site-specific configuration file that was created by 
	your instructor	for your system.

defs.h
	Various definitions needed by kernels.c and driver.c

clock.{c,h}
fcyc.{c,h}
	These contain timing routines that measure the performance of your
	code with our k-best measurement scheme using IA32 cycle counters.

Makefile:
	This is the makefile that builds the driver program.
